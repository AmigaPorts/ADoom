This archive contains the SAS/C Amiga source code of ADoom-1.4.  You
don't need it to play ADoom, only if you want to try and compile it or
look at how it works.  It can be compiled either for an Amiga using
SAS/C or for Linux using gcc.

See the file amiga_notes.txt for information about the source code.

The archive contains a few files that are not used.

ADoom was derived from the original ID Software Linux DOOM source
which you can download from:

   ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/source/doomsrc.zip
